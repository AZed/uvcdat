<h2><a name="Repository"></a>Direct Access to the Source Repository</h2>
<p>CDAT is an open-source project. So how do you see the source? </p>
<p>Our normal release cycle releases a set of sources at a stable point. 
However, you might want to get an update between releases because someone has 
made an improvement you would like to use. You can now do this yourself. Be 
aware that while we make every attempt to only commit source that is correct and 
working, and that we develop in separate &quot;branches&quot; to help ensure this, this 
direct access is inherently less stable than using our official releases.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it. In what follows, replace yourname with a name that 
reflects your name and machine, such as e.g. pcmdi-dubois-ldorritt. The name 
needs to be different for each different location where you work.</p>
<menu>
  <li>a. Go to <a href="http://perforce.com">http://perforce.com</a> and 
  download the &quot;p4&quot; client for your machine and install it in your path. This 
  download is free of charge. You'll need to chmod +x p4 after download, of 
  course. </li>
  <li>
  <pre>b. Set environment variable P4CONFIG to &quot;p4env&quot;.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>c. Create a directory and change to it. Create a file named p4env that 
  contains:<br>
  P4PORT=esg.llnl.gov:1666<br>
  P4USER=pcmdi<br>
  P4CLIENT=yourname<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>d. Execute: p4 info<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; If it prints out intelligent-looking stuff like what follows, your access 
  is set up correctly. Note the &quot;Client unknown&quot;. If it does not say this, 
  you'll need to pick a different user name because the one you chose is in use. 
  Use a different user name on </li>
</menu>
<pre>[dubois@ldorritt ~/foo]$ p4 info
User name: pcmdi
Client name: pcmdi-junk
Client host: ldorritt
Client unknown.
Current directory: /pcmdi/dubois/foo
Client address: 192.12.134.251:33720
Server address: esg.llnl.gov:1666
Server root: /p4root
Server date: 2002/03/25 09:29:23 PST
Server version: P4D/LINUX52X86/2001.1/26850 (2001/10/15)
Server license: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) 10 users (support ends 2003/03/01) </pre>
<menu>
  <li>e. Execute: p4 client<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Your editor will open on a client specification form. The last lines will 
  be something like:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; //depot/...&nbsp; //yourname/...</li>
</menu>
<blockquote>
  <p>Edit this to add &quot;main/&quot; right before the two sets of ...'s, so it reads:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; //depot/main/...&nbsp; //yourname/main/...<br>
  Save and close your editor. </p>
</blockquote>
<menu>
  <li>
  <pre>f. Type p4 sync now and any time you wish to update your sources.</pre>
  </li>
  <li>g. To get an official release, change &quot;main&quot; to release/3.2 or whatever 
  the release number is.</li>
</menu>
<p>You won't need to download from our website. And you'll find that p4 is VERY 
fast.</p>
<p>Perforce permits us to do this under our license; the read-only access for 
everyone only &quot;uses up&quot; one license. Write access for heavy contributors can be 
arranged by mutual agreement with PCMDI and payment of the Perforce license and 
annual support fee for an extra user (the license is about $750). You can always 
use the SourceForge patch facility to submit bug fixes if you do not have write 
access.</p>
<h2><a name="Website"></a>Web Site</h2>
<p>cdat.sf.net is a redirect page. Currently it redirects to esg.llnl.gov/cdat. 
The web site is on esg in /var/www/html/cdat. 
</p>
<h2><a name="Making Tarballs">Making Tarballs</a></h2>
<p>To make the tarballs, set up a Perforce client in a new directory, say 
pcmdi-tarball-dubois, using a map like this:</p>
<pre>//depot/main/... //pcmdi-tarball-dubois/cdat-X.x/...

Next create this shell script, call it tarballit.sh, and make it executable:</pre>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env sh
p4 sync
tar czvf $1-everything.tar.gz $1
tar czvf $1-cdat.tar.gz --exclude $1/pysrc* --exclude $1/exsrc* $1
tar czvf $1-pysrc.tar.gz $1/pysrc
tar czvf $1-exsrc.tar.gz $1/exsrc
</pre>
<pre>Finally, execute it giving as an argument a release name:</pre>
<pre>./tarballit cdat-X.x</pre>
<pre>This will create 3 tarballs.
cdat-X.x-cdat.tar.gz
cdat-X.x-everything.tar.gz
cdat-X.x-exsrc.tar.gz</pre>
<h2><a name="Making Releases">Making Releases</a></h2>
<p>Using anonymous FTP, upload your tarballs to: upload.sf.net, directory 
incoming, using binary transfer.</p>
<p>Log on to SourceForge using Netscape (or Internet Explorer but not in SSL 
mode). Go to the CDAT Project Page (sf.net/projects/cdat) and click &quot;Admin&quot;. 
Click &quot;Edit/Release Files&quot;. Proceed to either create a new release or edit one 
under project &quot;CDAT&quot;. (The 3.0 release was a mistake that we somehow don't have 
a way of destroying; note it is &quot;Hidden&quot;.)</p>
<p>When you get to the page for your release you will find the files you 
uploaded listed in one of the sections. Select them and click to transfer them 
to CDAT. Then you will have to select &quot;Platform Independent&quot; and &quot;Source .gz&quot; 
for each of them in turn and click update. In the upper sections you can paste 
in notes and the latest version of ReleaseNotes. </p>
<p>Notify users 3 ways: click &quot;I'm sure&quot; in the bottom of the release page and 
&quot;Send Email&quot;. Go to the project page again and select News and then Add News. 
Finally, send mail to <a href="mailto:cdat-discussion@lists.sf.net">
cdat-discussion@lists.sf.net</a>.</p>
<h2> <a name="Perforce Procedures"> Perforce Procedures</h2>
<p> This section is of interest to PCMDI only. </p>
<p> The server root is on esg.llnl.gov in /p4root. The files at the top level
are the files needed by Perforce; the directory depot contains the RCS files.
Some very old files come from a link to an old CVS tree.
</p>
<p> The server can be started using the script start_server. It can be stopped
using the script stop_server. Periodically it can be backed up by stopping the
server, running the script make_checkpoint, and tarring up the subdirectory 
depot. Perforce has some documentation. A more heavily used repository could be
backed up more carefully but since the file system is backed up this seems adequate.
</p>
<p>However, you should definitely do this procedure before upgrading the
daemon p4d. Periodically check Perforce.com for upgrades to servers and clients.
</p>
<p>The Perforce repository keeper should use crontab on their account on 
esg to execute start_server and review_cron.sh every ten minutes or so.
Do crontab -e and add two lines like:
<pre>
2,12,22,32,42,52 * * * * /p4root/start_server
1,11,21,31,41,51 * * * * /p4root/review_cron.sh
</pre>
For this to work you must be sure you can execute those two scripts manually.
</p>
<p> Note that none of the scripts take any arguments. </p>
