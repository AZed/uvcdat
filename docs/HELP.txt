Documentation for the install. Please read README.txt first.

In the following step you must execute the Python into which you intend to
install CDAT. Either use a full path name or make sure that the desired 
python is the one being chosen by your path. To emphasize this we'll show
the command as a full pathname below.

Usage: 

[CDAT_INSTALL_DIRECTORY]/bin/python install.py [options] [debug][contrib][controlfile, ...]
          options:
              -d or --debug: use debug options where appropriate
              -h or --help: print this message and stop
              -f or --force: force recompilation of everything
	      --prefix=/some/path : Allows to build in some directory other than the python directory
                                    Usefull if you cannot write to your python directory.
	      --disable-contrib: turn off build of contributed Packages
              --enable-opendap or --with-opendap=opendap_dir:
	         builds CDMS with OpenDAP client support
		 opendap_dir is the directorie underneath which the OpenDAP
		 include files and libraries are (in opendap_dir/include and opendap_dir/lib)
		 e.g: python install.py --with-opendap=dods_dir
	      --disable-opendap
	         turns off DODS
	      --enable-hdf, --with-hdf=hdf_dir:
	         builds CDMS with HDF support
		 hdf_dir is the directorie underneath which the HDF
		 include files and libraries are (in hdf_dir/include and hdf_dir/lib)
		 e.g: python install.py --with-hdf=hdf_dir
	      --cdms-only: builds cdms only
              -e or --echo: echo installation commands
              -n or --norun: Calculates the configuration if appropriate and
                             writes installation/cdat_info.py; but it is not
                             installed and processing in other areas is not
                             actually done. Often combined with --echo to 
                             see what would have happened.
              -c or --configuration=configuration_file: use configuration file
	         For example:

	      --enable-pp builds in support for
		 the Met Office PP format. (Default on Linux/Darwin systems)
	      --disable-pp: 
	         Turn Off PP support

        Additional arguments are control files containing Python statements. 
        These statements are executed at the beginning of the install, 
        after executing installation/control.py. 

If you stop without seeing a Success! message, the build has failed and
you should examine the log for the piece it was working on when it failed.
For comparison the subdirectory "logs/samples" contains the log files for 
a build on Linux.
